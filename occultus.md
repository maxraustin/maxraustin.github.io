## Project Description

---

*Created with C# scripting in the Unity game engine*

This is an unreleased small project I started while in school. While the game is incomplete, I have released various playable test builds while developing it. Links for those will be at the end for any interested.

The game is a 2D side scrolling platformer designed to be similar in overall feel and challenge to "retro" platforming games such as Ninja Gaiden or Castlevania. My part in the project has been all the programming and game design as well as nearly all of art assets. All music was produced by contractors, though sounds were made by myself.

## Feature List

---

* 2D action platforming gameplay
* 6 different stages with different hazards/enemies for players to face
* Two difficulties with different enemy placements/boss moves/mechanics
* "Pixel perfect" camera using manipulation of resolution scaling in Unity(ie no subpixel movement)
* Controller support for most major controller types
* CRT-stylized shader

## Test Build

If you are interested in trying out the game, the last build I released is here, which was originally intended for a Kickstarter idea that didn't pan out. Windows 7+

Keep in mind that this was a test build from 2018, and thus has a few bugs and missing features like controller support.
